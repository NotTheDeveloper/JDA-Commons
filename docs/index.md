> <br>**channel** - The **MessageChannel**, which should be initialized.
> <br>**amount** - The amount of messages to delete.
> <br>Returns: A **List** of messages representing the precursor of all deletion tasks.
> <br>Annotation: **NotNull**, **CheckReturnValue**
```swift
checkClearSafety(@NotNull MessageChannel, int, @NotNull ClearSafety...)
