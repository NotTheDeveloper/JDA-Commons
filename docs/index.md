Of course you can not get an interface. <br>
Because of this you need a [command manager](https://github.com/BlockyDotJar/JDA-Commons/blob/main/src/test/java/dev/blocky/discord/CommandManager.java) to use this interface.

### Methods

> A simple command interface, which you can use to easily program message commands.
