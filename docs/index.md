```

### Methods

> Represents a <b>new VoiceRecorder</b> instance.
>
> Returns: A <b>new VoiceRecorder</b> instance.
> <br>Annotation: **NotNull**
```swift
newRecorder()
```
<br>

> Sets the volume of the recorded audio.
> <br>If the volume isn't set the volume will be automatically set to 1.0.
> <br>This method should only be used if the value is greater or smaller than 1.0.
>
> Parameter: **volume** - The volume of the audio to be recorded.
> <br>Returns: The current instance of the **VoiceRecorder** class.
> <br>Annotation: **NotNull**
```swift
setVolume(double)
```
<br>

> Sets the **AudioReceivedHandler** that the **AudioManager** will use to
> process audio data received from an **AudioConnection**.
> <br>The handler provided here will persist between **AudioConnection** connect and disconnects.
> <br>Furthermore, you don't need to have an **AudioConnection** to set a handler.
> <br>When **JDA** sets up a <b>new AudioConnection</b> it will use the handler provided here.
> <br>Setting this to <code>null</code> will remove the **AudioReceivedHandler**.
>
> Parameter: **guild** - The **Guild** to receive the audio from.

<br>

> Sets if the audio should be stacked or not.
> <br>This means that you set, if the audio will or will not be removed from the **ConcurrentLinkedQueue**
> when the recording is finished.
> <br>This is useful if you want to record multiple conversations in one audio file.
> <br>If you want that the audio will be removed from the queue and thus with each join the audio file will be reinitialized, set this to <code>false</code>.
> <br>If the boolean isn't set this will be automatically set to <code>false</code>.
> <br>This method should only be used if the value is <code>true</code>.
>
> Parameter: **shouldStack** - Whether the audio should be stacked.
> <br>Returns: The current instance of the **VoiceRecorder** class.

> <p>This method will start recording audio from the **VoiceChannel** that the bot is currently in.
> <br>This method will return a **File** that contains the audio that was recorded.
>
> <p>This is recommended to use in the **ListenerAdapter#onGuildVoiceLeave(GuildVoiceLeaveEvent)** method.
> <br>Note that the **AudioConnection** should be closed before this method is called.
>
> <p>This method supports any kind of audio file.
> <br>Following audio file-formats are tested:
> <br>- <code>.wav</code>
> <br>- <code>.mp3</code>
> <br>- <code>.ogg</code>
> <br>- <code>.opus</code>

> The **AudioManager** that represents the **AudioConnection** for this **Guild**.
> <br>If no **AudioManager** exists for this **Guild**, this will create a <b>new</b> one.
> <br>This operation is <code>synchronized</code> on all **AudioManager** for this **JDA** instance, this means
> that calling <code>getAudioManager()</code> on any other **Guild** while a thread is accessing this method may be locked.
>
> Returns: The **AudioManager** for this **Guild**.
> <br>Annotation: **Nullable**, **CheckReturnValue**
```swift
